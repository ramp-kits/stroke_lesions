    "Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor-intensive, time consuming, and require anatomical expertise and training. Manual segmentation can also be subjective. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the resulting lesion masks often lack the accuracy needed to make them viable solutions. However, newer algorithms that employ machine-learning and deep learning techniques are promising avenues, but they require large, diverse datasets for training and testing and developing generalizable models. In this challenge, training can be performed on our public ATLAS 2.0 dataset, and testing is done with a hidden private dataset comprised of multi-site data from the same sites as ATLAS 2.0. <BR>\n",
